     <p>Where are our servers situated? Please be advised that if you are visiting our website from outside, we may transfer, store, and process your information at our facilities as well as those of third parties that we may share your personal information with.</p>
     <p>The regulations pertaining to data protection and other related matters may not be as extensive in these nations as they are in your own, if you live in the European Economic Area. Nonetheless, we will take all required precautions to safeguard your personal data in compliance with this privacy statement and all applicable laws.</p>
     <h5 class="fw-bold">HOW MUCH TIME DO WE STORE YOUR DATA?</h5>
     <p>If a longer retention time is mandated or authorized by law, we will only retain your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes outlined in this privacy notice (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). We will not be retaining your personal information for more than six months for any of the purposes stated in this notice.</p>
     <p>In the event that we no longer have a valid business reason to process your personal data, we will either erase it or make it anonymous. If this is not feasible (for instance, because it is kept in backup archives), we will safely store it and keep it separate from any additional processing until deletion is feasible.</p>
     <h5 class="fw-bold">IN WHAT WAYS DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?</h5>
     <p>To ensure the protection of any personal information we process, we have put in place the necessary organizational and technical security measures. We cannot, however, guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties won't be able to circumvent our security measures and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. This is because no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You bear all liability for transmitting personal information to and from our website, even though we will take reasonable precautions to protect it. The Website should only be accessed in a safe setting.</p>

There is currently no established common technical standard for identifying and utilizing DNT signals.
